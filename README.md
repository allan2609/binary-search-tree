# binary-search-tree

The assignment is building a balanced binary search tree, without using duplicate values.

The Node class has an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children.

The Tree class accepts an array when initialized. The Tree class has a root attribute, which uses the return value of buildTree.

The Tree class has a number of functions, such as insert, deleteItem, find.

In order to visualize the binary search tree, there is a prettyPrint() function that will console.log the tree in a structured format.

A sample tree (const tree) is at the end of the script which gets printed when the script is run. Functions from the Tree class can be tested on this tree.
